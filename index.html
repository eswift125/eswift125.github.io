        Welcome to the github page for Matthew Abazis and Elijah Swift.
        We are working on a project for our Cyber Physical Systems Security
        class. Our goal is to implement a method of long range RFID scanning.
        We then plan to use these scanned IDs for some sort of replay attack
        to gain "unauthorized" entrance to a "secure" location on Binghamton
        University's campus.
