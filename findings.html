          Well we have not found a whole lot just yet, but here is where we stand
          (updated 10/22/2018).

          We started out by doing a bit of research into the type of RFID cards
          that Binghamton uses (there's some identifying information on the cards
          themselves indicating that they are HID 0008P cards). We found the frequency
          range we believe the cards function at and ordered a couple of simple,
          lightweight RFID readers that should have been able to get something from
          our cards. This proved ineffective, so we did more digging into the specifics
          of the RFID cards. We found some helpful research on the kind of device
          we're hoping to build (it's not exactly a research paper but
          https://www.bishopfox.com/resources/tools/rfid-hacking/attack-tools/
          is a good resource) and ordered more parts for it. These parts have come
          in, but we haven't launched construction and testing just yet (we're
          going to get into that this week).
