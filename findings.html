          Well we have not found a whole lot just yet, but here is where we stand
          (updated 12/3/2018).

          We started out by doing a bit of research into the type of RFID cards
          that Binghamton uses (there's some identifying information on the cards
          themselves indicating that they are HID 0008P cards). We found the frequency
          range we believe the cards function at and ordered a couple of simple,
          lightweight RFID readers that should have been able to get something from
          our cards. This proved ineffective, so we did more digging into the specifics
          of the RFID cards. We found some helpful research on the kind of device
          we're hoping to build (it's not exactly a research paper but
          https://www.bishopfox.com/resources/tools/rfid-hacking/attack-tools/
          is a good resource) and ordered more parts for it.

          After lots of trial and error, we found an RFID reader that read our
          HID cards. It sends (over serial connection) what we believe to be the
          16-bit data field of the ID cards. We also discovered the RFID scanners
          in the new printing system serial print (seemingly) both the header and
          data fields. We also identified a writer that should write to the same
          kind of card that we seek to clone. We recieved this writer yesterday,
          and plan to undergo thorough testing later this week.
